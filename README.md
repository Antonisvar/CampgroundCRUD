I have deployed the site on Render:
https://campgroundcrud.onrender.com/campgrounds

A full-stack Node.js web application built with Express that implements a RESTful API for managing campgrounds. The app features full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with user authentication and authorization using Passport.js. Users can sign up, log in, and perform actions based on their roles. The app also integrates with Cloudinary for secure image hosting and uses flash messages to provide feedback on actions like campground creation, updates, and deletions. This project showcases the use of modern web development practices, including cloud-based image storage.
